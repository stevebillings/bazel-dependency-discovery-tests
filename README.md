# Bazel External Dependency Discovery Test Projects

This is a collection of bazel projects for testing approaches to discovering external dependencies across different bazel projects (especially different repository rule types).

There's one test project (subdir) for each repository rule type. At the moment there are only 6, so only a tiny fraction of repository rule types are covered.

## Getting started

There's a very crude RUNME.sh at the top level that runs the (also very crude) tests.
